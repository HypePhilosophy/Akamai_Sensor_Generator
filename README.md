# Akamai Sensor Generator
This repository is for research purposes only. It is a functional Akamai sensor generator, however is on version 1.52 of Akamai Anti-bot. In order to function on the newest Akamai version, it must be revamped, and some portions must be rewritten.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Run the command `npm run electron`

## Methodology
The Akamai Sensor Generator was created by reversing the obfuscated Akamai Collector script, which can be found [here.](https://us.louisvuitton.com/bundles/f07e41afui210f89b730060204942b)

Using [de4js](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) and selecting array, you are able to view the raw JS code that Akamai uses to determine if you are a human or not.

The Sensor Generator works like this:
1. Visit website to obtain temporary Akamai cookie
2. Using temp akamai cookie, spoof values for the sensor string
3. Submit cookie + spoofed values to akamai collector url
4. Receive valid Akamai cookie

Cookies are valid for a year, except some websites may choose to clear them at any time.

## Notes
This Sensor generator is in fact, considered outdated. Akamai implemented ja3 ssl/tls checks as well as several new functions to their updated versions to prevent this code from running at scale. Yet this is not meant to be used for large scale Akamai cookie genning, but rather for research and a guide for future generators.

P.S. It is missing the MACT function for mouse tracking. For any relevant tests you can replace that function with [Ghost cursor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor).

## Reflections
Thank you to [Eric](https://github.com/ericz99) and [Zed](https://github.com/zedd3v) for making this possible. This was a fun project and hopefully will find new life in guiding others.
